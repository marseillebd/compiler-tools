# Work Log

I've finished lexeme assembly.
This creates:
- numbers
- strings
- indentation

I decided to detect indentation (but not match up indentation levels) here because is't the assembly of a newline with whitespace.

I'll need still to alter indentation tokens into indent/nextline/dedent tokens, but I think that might be a "sandhi" rule.

## Future Work

I'm very noot confident in error recovery for number assembly.
Things seem to be straightforward, but I'm not going to know it's all good until I test the error paths.
